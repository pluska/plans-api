# Overview

This project is an emergency preparedness API that helps users create and manage personalized emergency plans. The system provides step-by-step guidance for different types of emergency scenarios, including natural disasters, economic crises, and general preparedness. The API uses TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainable code structure.

The software demonstrates the power of TypeScript in building robust backend services. It showcases features like:
- Strong typing for API requests and responses
- Async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Class-based service architecture
- Comprehensive error handling
- Integration with external services (Redis for caching)

The purpose of this project is to create a scalable and maintainable API that can help people prepare for emergencies. By using TypeScript, we ensure that the code is reliable and easy to maintain, while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
